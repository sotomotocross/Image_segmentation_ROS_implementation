"""
Test script for the detection module.

This script contains test cases for the classes and functions in the [Your Package Name] module.
It checks the functionality of the FeatureCalculator and DetectionProcessor classes.

To run the tests, execute this script in the same environment where your ROS workspace is sourced.

Usage:
    $ python test.py

Make sure to update [Your Package Name] with the actual name of your package.

Note: Adjust the dummy inputs in the test functions based on your actual implementation.
